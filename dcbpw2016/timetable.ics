DESCRIPTION:Schedule (not yet in order)\n\nForm::Diva\n\n\nThese Lig­htn­in
 g Talks may be seri­ous\, funny\, or both. They may be given by ex­perien­
 ced speak­ers al­ready giv­ing full length talks or by first time speak­er
 s just start­ing out (this is a great way to get star­ted if you have some
 ­th­ing to say). If you are a first time speak­er you will win a tie with 
 an ex­peri­ence speak­er when the schedule is made if it comes to it. Toda
 y's first time speak­er could give tomor­row's keynote.\n\nWe will have ab
 out 5 Lig­htn­ing Talks of 5 minutes. Sub­mit your talk through the sub­mi
 t talk link on this web­site. The first de­ad­line is with the full length
  talks. The second de­ad­line is one week be­fore the con­fer­ence starts 
 and many pro­pos­als will be ac­cepted. At least one speak­ing spot will b
 e held open until the morning of the talks to give you a chan­ce to see so
 me­th­ing at the con­fer­ence and put togeth­er a Lig­htn­ing Talk re­spon
 ­se. Howev­er if you wait for the later de­ad­lines note that there are fe
 wer spots avail­able and you are less li­ke­ly to be ac­cepted so please t
 ry to sub­mit more than a week be­fore the con­fer­ence.\n\nIn ad­di­tion 
 to the five minute Lig­htn­ing Talks where you get to use your com­put­er\
 , slides\, and any other tool\, we will also have some Lig­htn­ing Ad­vert
 ise­ments. These are only 30 seconds\, you don't have to sub­mit a pro­pos
 ­al\, you don't get any slides\, and the only AV as­sis­tance of­fered is 
 a micro­phone. If you have a BOF to an­noun­ce\, an auc­tion item so ad­ve
 rt­ise or any other short mes­sage you can use the trans­i­tion time that 
 would be ot­herw­ise was­ted bet­ween Lig­htn­ing Talks to share your mes­
 sage. Just show up be­fore we start and take a seat in the as­sig­ned seat
 s in the front of the room.\n\nWhy Would You Want to do a Lig­htn­ing Talk
 ? Maybe you've never given a talk be­fore\, and you'd like to start small.
  For a Lig­htn­ing Talk\, you don't need to make slides\, and if you do de
 ­cide to make slides\, you only need to make three. Maybe you're nerv­ous 
 and you're af­raid you'll mess up. It's a lot eas­i­er to plan and de­liv­
 er a five minute talk than it is to de­liv­er a long talk. And if you do m
 ess up\, at least the pain­ful part will be over quick­ly. Maybe you don't
  have much to say. Maybe you just want to ask a ques­tion\, or in­vite peo
 ­ple to help you with your pro­ject\, or boast about some­th­ing you did\,
  or tell a short cautiona­ry story. These th­ings are all in­terest­ing an
 d worth talk­ing about\, but there might not be en­ough to say about them 
 to fill up thir­ty minutes. Maybe you have a lot of th­ings to say\, and y
 ou're al­ready going to give a long talk on one of them\, and you don't wa
 nt to hog the spot­light. There's noth­ing wrong with giv­ing sever­al Lig
 ­htn­ing Talks. Hey\, they're only five minutes. On the other side\, peo­p
 le might want to come to a lig­htn­ing talk when they would­n't come to a 
 long talk on the same sub­ject. The risk for the at­tendees is small­er: I
 f the talk turns out to be dull\, or if the per­son giv­ing the talk turns
  out to be a rea­l­ly bad speak­er\, well\, at least it's over in five min
 utes. With lig­htn­ing talks\, you're never stuck in some bor­ing lec­ture
  for forty-five minutes.\n\nStill hav­ing troub­le pick­ing a topic\, here
  are some sug­ges­tions:\n\n1. Why my favorite module is X.\n2. I want to 
 do cool pro­ject X. Does an­yone want to help?\n3. Suc­cess­ful Pro­ject: 
 I did pro­ject X. It was a suc­cess. Here's how you could be­nefit.\n4. Fa
 iled Pro­ject: I did pro­ject X. It was a failure\, and here's why.\n5. He
 resy: Peo­ple al­ways say X\, but they're wrong. Here's why.\n6. You All S
 uck: Here's what is wrong with the our com­mun­ity. 7. Call to Ac­tion: Le
 t's all do more of X / less of X.\n8. Would­n't it be cool if X?\n9. Some­
 one needs to do X.\n10. Wish List\n11. Why X was a mis­take.\n12. Why X lo
 oks like a mis­take\, but isn't.\n13. What it's like to do X.\n14. Here's 
 a use­ful tech­nique that wor­ked.\n15. Here's a tech­nique I thought woul
 d be use­ful but didn't work.\n16. Why al­gorithm X sucks.\n17. Com­pariso
 n of al­gorithms X and Y.\n\nOf co­ur­se\, you could give the talk on an­y
 th­ing you wan­ted\, wheth­er or not it is on this list. If we get a full 
 schedule of noth­ing but five minutes of rant­ing and rav­ing on each topi
 c\, a good time will still be had by most.

DESCRIPTION:Negativity surrounds the concept of existing code. This negativ
 ity is baked into the language we use. We work on 'legacy projects'\, 'dir
 t field projects'\, 'rescue projects'\, 'antiquated projects'\, 'ancient p
 rojects'. I'd like to use the construction metaphor to look at these proje
 cts in a different light. I've been inspired by the TV program\, 'This Old
  House'. I think the care and attention that's given existing structures w
 hile making them do more for their inhabitants is a great model for how we
  can treat our software projects. This talk isn't language specific\; it's
  themes and guidance will apply to anyone who's worked on a project that s
 omeone else left behind or anyone who is likely to do so in the future.

DESCRIPTION:Foreign Function Interface (FFI) is a great alternative to XS f
 or writing extensions for Perl that rely on machine code (C/C++ Rust\, For
 tran and the like).  With the release of FFI::Platypus this year\, perform
 ance and ease of development has improved significantly for those extendin
 g Perl using FFI.  In this all new talk\, we will cover several small but 
 practical topics\, including performance\, records (C “structs”) and forei
 gn language interoperability (calling languages other than C).  We will fi
 nish off with some thoughts about the future of Perl and FFI.

DESCRIPTION:Scripting is commonly used by information security professional
 s as a means of evaluating the security  of systems as well as a means of 
 analyzing the data gathered from various information systems. In recent ye
 ars Python has gathered much of the attention of the InfoSec community due
  to the development of projects like Scapy and the release of resources li
 ke “Violent Python”.  Perl\, however\, should not be underestimated when i
 t comes to it's ability for evaluating and improving the security of enter
 prise IT environments.  This talk will demonstrate several example scripts
  which highlight the potential for applying Perl based solutions to real w
 orld information security challenges.

DESCRIPTION:A tags file is an index of Perl code: function definitions\, pa
 ckages\, constants\, and so on. Most popular text editors support tags and
  make Perl code easy to browse. We will cover how to create tags files for
  Perl code: tools\, editors\, patterns.\n\nWe will take a quick glance at 
 structure of tags file and see that it is pretty simple. One can create ta
 gs files for Perl-related stuff\, for example configuration files read by 
 AppConfig.

DESCRIPTION:Cron is a really useful tool\, but if you're not careful\, you 
 end up with e-mail few minutes reporting that something was run.  If you d
 on't go through every last report examining it line by line\, you might mi
 ss when something actually breaks.\n\nAfter years of putting up with it or
  writing wrapper scripts that silence output unless certain conditions are
  met\, I've created a more generic wrapper that can :\n\n* handle 'highlan
 der' conditions\n* kill commands that run too long\n* silence output unles
 s a non-zero exit status\n* silence output unless something's sent to STDE
 RR\n* silence output if it matches acceptable patterns\n* highlight lines 
 that aren't in the list of patterns\n\nNote that this code is not yet rele
 ased.  My place of work has a formal 'software release' procedure that I'm
  still trying to work through.

DESCRIPTION:Being a Perl Shop is hard sometimes\, and as a result you somet
 imes miss out on some of the super-awesome third party support that other 
 - some would say\, weaker (but of course we wouldn’t say that\, we’re clas
 sy) - languages enjoy. So I had to get my hands dirty. As such\, I contrib
 uted to the development of the Net::AMQP::RabbitMQ module so that we at Th
 inkGeek could properly integrate our Perl applications with this MQ server
 .\n\nI will walk you through a very high level of the integration itself\,
  some of the challenges we faced\, and how we overcame them. I’ll also go 
 through some of the improvements I’ve made as part of the team of people m
 aintaining the Net::AMQP::RabbitMQ module. BEWARE\, however\, this talk is
  not for the squeamish. There will be guts. perlguts\, and they’ll be ever
 ywhere.

DESCRIPTION:So\, in lieu of better talks\, it might be worth having a discu
 ssion about something a little meta to Perl\, and that would be community.
   As a member of the Code-for-NoVA 'brigade\,' I have interfaced quite ext
 ensively with a slew of folks of varying skill levels\, almost none of who
 m have interacted with Perl either lately or ever.  They even tend to look
  down on the language as 'old' and 'what relevance could it have anymore?'
   Now\, WE know that it is just as good as common stalwarts at these event
 s\, such as Python\, Ruby\, et cetera... so it seems to me\, perl might at
 tract a few more enthusiasts by deploying itself into the civic hacking co
 mmunity.

 's native RESTful HTTP interface. Nodes and relationships (edges) in the g
 raph are represented as Perl objects\, and graph operations and queries ca
 n be executed in a familiar\, DBI-esque way. This talk will briefly introd
 uce some graph database concepts and demonstrate how these can be easily e
 xpressed in REST::Neo4p. Some advanced features\, such as implementing tra
 nsactions and batch processing\, will be touched on as time allows.
