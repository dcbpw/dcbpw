            <p>The DC and Baltimore Perlmongers invite you to join us for a workshop at the <a href="/dcbpw2016/venue/">University of Baltimore in Baltimore, MD</a>, on <strong>Saturday, April 16, 2016</strong>, followed by a hackathon on <strong>Sunday, April 17, 2016</strong>! The workshop will have two tracks of speakers, discussing innovative, exciting, and fun real-world usage of Perl. The hackathon will be more free-form project time, though we may have some organized hands-on activities for those interested.</p>

                You are cordially invited to submit talks for the 2016
                DC-Baltimore Perl Workshop, which will be held on Saturday,
                April 16, 2016, in <a href="/dcbpw2016/venue/">Baltimore, MD</a>!
                </p>
                <p>
                Submit via the <a

                </p>
                <p>
                As in previous years, by default talks are 25 minutes, which
                we've found is a sweet spot for most topics. We get a great
                variety -- enough to get a dose of newness and not overwhelm.
                We also welcome proposals for more tutorial-style talks of
                around 50 minutes. We'll take the talks and build out a
                two-track schedule.
                </p>
                <p>
                Speakers of all levels are welcome! This regional meetup is
                great for getting your first taste of giving a community
                talk, sharing projects or topics that you have experience
                with, or even doing a first run for a talk you'll be
                presenting at a larger conference! All Perl-related topics
                are welcome -- from beginner to advanced, from technical to
                social.
                </p>
                <p>
                No need to submit talks for the Sunday April 17 hackathon --
                we'll have more info on that code and learning festival in
                future updates! And of course -- all are welcome to register
                for the conference -- this year you can register over at <a
