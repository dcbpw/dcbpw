The intent is to make CPAN more reliable without requiring the intervention of the installation user. This has a number of tradeoffs, but I will argue with specific case examples that on balance they favor the use of Alien techniques. I will briefly touch on some technical decisions that the Alien::Base team has made since I took over as the primary maintainer, and the next big steps that Alien needs to make to further capitalize on the progress that we’ve made.</div>

                    advanced training, code review, programming (green field and
                    maintenance), and consulting around modernizing your Perl code or
                    migrating to other platforms/technologies.

                You are cordially invited to submit talks for the 2016
                DC-Baltimore Perl Workshop, which will be held on Saturday,
                April 16, 2016, in <a href="/dcbpw2016/venue/">Baltimore, MD</a>!
                </p>
                <p>
                Submit via the <a
                                      href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1wk9V7THT_SA5mq2lH_qJEMoR0QSQ53Pch-5bMhRpOQs/viewform">Google
                                      Form</a> (a new experiment this year).
                </p>
                <p>
                As in previous years, by default talks are 25 minutes, which
                we've found is a sweet spot for most topics. We get a great
                variety -- enough to get a dose of newness and not overwhelm.
                We also welcome proposals for more tutorial-style talks of
                around 50 minutes. We'll take the talks and build out a
                two-track schedule.
                </p>
                <p>
                Speakers of all levels are welcome! This regional meetup is
                great for getting your first taste of giving a community
                talk, sharing projects or topics that you have experience
                with, or even doing a first run for a talk you'll be
                presenting at a larger conference! All Perl-related topics
                are welcome -- from beginner to advanced, from technical to
                social.
                </p>
                <p>
                No need to submit talks for the Sunday April 17 hackathon --
                we'll have more info on that code and learning festival in
                future updates! And of course -- all are welcome to register
                for the conference -- this year you can register over at <a
