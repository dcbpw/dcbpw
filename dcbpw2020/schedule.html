                        Fast! Perl Bindings With Platypus (25min)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Letâ€™s go on a journey where we discover new techniques for the next decade 
                        for creating Perl library bindings!  You may already be aware that FFI is a 
                        technique for calling other languages without having to delve into the guts 
                        of Perl with XS.  You have probably heard that Platypus (FFI::Platypus) is 
                        the most practical, advanced and best supported FFI library on CPAN.  
                        What you may not be aware of is that the Platypus team has been working tools 
                        to generate libraries based from C header files and other forms of foreign 
                        programming language introspection.  The author of Platypus will show how these 
                        tools will make it faster and safer to write library bindings.

                    <p>
                        Thinking in terms of incentives can help your team decide who "should" hold a 
                        each responsibility. Personal examples will help clarify each big point:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            How can we talk about and visualize responsibilities?
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Who "should" be responsible for each responsibility, based on natural 
                            incentives? (ideal) Who can do it? (actual)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Engineering-generated backlog + product-generated backlog = team backlog
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Product's user stories vs engineering's tasks - two perspectives on 
                            tracking work. Conflict around tracking work often comes from their 
                            conflation.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Benefits of crossover - like devs on user interviews, and product in the code
                        </li>

                    <p>
                        If your team isn't doing these but you think it should, how can you 
                        influence this? (incentives!)

                    <p>
                        Docker is a platform for building, managing, deploying and running
                        containers.  Docker::API provides a friendly interface for automating
                        docker container management from within Raku.  Build new containers,
                        run them, monitor them, interact with them, etc. all from your Raku
                        programs.

                    <p>
                        Prior Docker knowledge or experience is helpful, but not required.

                        "Yes, of course!" â€” the benefits of having an established coding style for a 
                        project, having rules around how things are formatted, what language features 
                        are to be used and which are to be avoided, seem obvious. It makes it easier 
                        to onboard new contributors, establishes a baseline expectation for drive-by 
                        pull requests, and makes the code review process more transparent.

                    <p>
                        But style guides aren't free. Setting one up can involve a significant amount 
                        of effort, and, depending on the number of contributors involved in the 
                        discussion, can be a significant source of stress and strife. Many projects 
                        have been highly successful with nary a hint of any sort of overall style 
                        guidance.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So what's a maintainer to do? Style guide, or no? Come to this talk to learn 
                        more about the tradeoffs between having a style guide and not having a style 
                        guide, as well as some tooling options that you may not be aware of that will 
                        make it easier to move towards having some style guidelines, without having to 
                        invest a bunch of upfront effort into something you may end up hating.

                        This talk is about using Vault to solve some common problems involving secrets
                        (such as database credentials or API keys). As this is a short talk, I'll only
                        be covering the basics (if you end up needing a longer talk, I can go to to 55
                        minutes and cover more).

                        Thanks to Ingy's brand of infernal genius, you can program just about any 
                        language in Perl, nearly for free. Just write a fairly sane interface in the 
                        language, inline it, and call it from Perl.

                        Remedial Math For Programmers (55min)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My inspiration for this talk was twofold. First, it's a review of math
                        I needed to relearn when I began working on my PhD in computer science. 
                        Second, I wanted the topics I covered to be useful and practical for a 
                        broad set of programming problems.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That said, there's a lot of math in the talk. I gave a version of this
                        talk at FOSSCON 2019. In 50 minutes I covered everything from
                        logarithms to eigenvalues. It really is possible to cover the basics
                        of eigenvalues in just a few minutes!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My original coding examples were in Python. I'll convert as many as
                        possible to Perl, but I may need to keep one in Python (a graphical
                        bouncing ball that uses the sine function) if I can't find a suitable
                        Perl equivalent.
