                        Fast! Perl Bindings With Platypus (25min)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Let’s go on a journey where we discover new techniques for the next decade 
                        for creating Perl library bindings!  You may already be aware that FFI is a 
                        technique for calling other languages without having to delve into the guts 
                        of Perl with XS.  You have probably heard that Platypus (FFI::Platypus) is 
                        the most practical, advanced and best supported FFI library on CPAN.  
                        What you may not be aware of is that the Platypus team has been working tools 
                        to generate libraries based from C header files and other forms of foreign 
                        programming language introspection.  The author of Platypus will show how these 
                        tools will make it faster and safer to write library bindings.

                        R can Change your Life (25min)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        R is a language and environment for statistical programming, and an open-source 
                        version of S (or S-plus). It allows integration with other languages (e.g., C++, 
                        Java, Python) and communicates with many sources, such as ODBC-compliant databases 
                        and statistical packages (e.g., SAS, STATA, SPSS). But most importantly, R changed 
                        my life, and it can change yours. After years of working as a SAS programmer, I 
                        became a private consultant and was shocked at the annual SAS licensing fee. Open 
                        source software was the only viable solution. R’s flexibility and open source status 
                        has led to dramatic increases in it’s use. Currently there are more than 15,000 
                        available packages on the official CRAN repository, and another 1800 libraries for 
                        genomic analysis on BioConductor. R is incredibly popular for data management, 
                        statistical analysis, and data visualization, making R programming a highly employable 
                        skill – and the reason I was hired for my current job. A quick search in early 2019 
                        on zip recruiter found over 3400 R programmer jobs within 50 miles of Baltimore. 
                        There are numerous online resources for learning R, enabling people to learn a highly 
                        employable skill for free. This talk will provide a quick introduction to R and an 
                        overview of several areas where it really excels, with examples. Resources for more 
                        information, free courses, and tutorials will be provided. Life changing effects are 
                        up to you.

                        Thinking in terms of incentives can help your team decide who "should" hold a 
                        each responsibility. Personal examples will help clarify each big point:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            How can we talk about and visualize responsibilities?
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Who "should" be responsible for each responsibility, based on natural 
                            incentives? (ideal) Who can do it? (actual)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Engineering-generated backlog + product-generated backlog = team backlog
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Product's user stories vs engineering's tasks - two perspectives on 
                            tracking work. Conflict around tracking work often comes from their 
                            conflation.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Benefits of crossover - like devs on user interviews, and product in the code
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        If your team isn't doing these but you think it should, how can you

                        Introduction to using MCE and MCE::Shared to parallelize your Perl 
                        code, take advantage of all your CPU cores, and run your program in a 
                        fraction of the time. MCE excels with bioinformatics, finance, or 
                        other big data, or with queued jobs; runs on all OSes and Perl versions 
                        back to 5.8.

                        I've been a professional Perl programmer since 1996 when we started 
                        building the interwebs with CGI.pm. For the last few years I've been 
                        on a small team developing core service-bridging APIs for a large 
                        internet hosting provider.

                        Once more with style: considering whether your project needs a style guide (25m)

                    <p>
                        Would your Open Source software project benefit from a style guide? Would your 
                        project at work? It's tempting to reply to these questions with a reflexive 
                        "Yes, of course!" — the benefits of having an established coding style for a 
                        project, having rules around how things are formatted, what language features 
                        are to be used and which are to be avoided, seem obvious. It makes it easier 
                        to onboard new contributors, establishes a baseline expectation for drive-by 
                        pull requests, and makes the code review process more transparent.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But style guides aren't free. Setting one up can involve a significant amount 
                        of effort, and, depending on the number of contributors involved in the 
                        discussion, can be a significant source of stress and strife. Many projects 
                        have been highly successful with nary a hint of any sort of overall style 
                        guidance.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So what's a maintainer to do? Style guide, or no? Come to this talk to learn 
                        more about the tradeoffs between having a style guide and not having a style 
                        guide, as well as some tooling options that you may not be aware of that will 
                        make it easier to move towards having some style guidelines, without having to 
                        invest a bunch of upfront effort into something you may end up hating.

                        Remedial Math For Programmers (55min)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My inspiration for this talk was twofold. First, it's a review of math
                        I needed to relearn when I began working on my PhD in computer science. 
                        Second, I wanted the topics I covered to be useful and practical for a 
                        broad set of programming problems.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That said, there's a lot of math in the talk. I gave a version of this
                        talk at FOSSCON 2019. In 50 minutes I covered everything from
                        logarithms to eigenvalues. It really is possible to cover the basics
                        of eigenvalues in just a few minutes!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My original coding examples were in Python. I'll convert as many as
                        possible to Perl, but I may need to keep one in Python (a graphical
                        bouncing ball that uses the sine function) if I can't find a suitable
                        Perl equivalent.                   
                    </p>

                        pointing out things that Perl does better than Python to his friends
                        and coworkers. He enjoys Perl, Python, regular expressions,
