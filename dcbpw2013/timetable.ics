DESCRIPTION:These Lig­htn­ing Talks may be seri­ous\, funny\, or both. They
  may be given by ex­perien­ced speak­ers al­ready giv­ing full length talk
 s or by first time speak­ers just start­ing out (this is a great way to ge
 t star­ted if you have some­th­ing to say). If you are a first time speak­
 er you will win a tie with an ex­peri­ence speak­er when the schedule is m
 ade if it comes to it. Today's first time speak­er could give tomor­row's 
 keynote.\n\nWe will have about 5 Lig­htn­ing Talks of 5 minutes. Sub­mit y
 our talk through the sub­mit talk link on this web­site. The first de­ad­l
 ine is with the full length talks. The second de­ad­line is one week be­fo
 re the con­fer­ence starts and many pro­pos­als will be ac­cepted. At leas
 t one speak­ing spot will be held open until the morning of the talks to g
 ive you a chan­ce to see some­th­ing at the con­fer­ence and put togeth­er
  a Lig­htn­ing Talk re­spon­se. Howev­er if you wait for the later de­ad­l
 ines note that there are fewer spots avail­able and you are less li­ke­ly 
 to be ac­cepted so please try to sub­mit more than a week be­fore the con­
 fer­ence.\n\nIn ad­di­tion to the five minute Lig­htn­ing Talks where you 
 get to use your com­put­er\, slides\, and any other tool\, we will also ha
 ve some Lig­htn­ing Ad­vertise­ments. These are only 30 seconds\, you don'
 t have to sub­mit a pro­pos­al\, you don't get any slides\, and the only A
 V as­sis­tance of­fered is a micro­phone. If you have a BOF to an­noun­ce\
 , an auc­tion item so ad­vert­ise or any other short mes­sage you can use 
 the trans­i­tion time that would be ot­herw­ise was­ted bet­ween Lig­htn­i
 ng Talks to share your mes­sage. Just show up be­fore we start and take a 
 seat in the as­sig­ned seats in the front of the room.\n\nWhy Would You Wa
 nt to do a Lig­htn­ing Talk? Maybe you've never given a talk be­fore\, and
  you'd like to start small. For a Lig­htn­ing Talk\, you don't need to mak
 e slides\, and if you do de­cide to make slides\, you only need to make th
 ree. Maybe you're nerv­ous and you're af­raid you'll mess up. It's a lot e
 as­i­er to plan and de­liv­er a five minute talk than it is to de­liv­er a
  long talk. And if you do mess up\, at least the pain­ful part will be ove
 r quick­ly. Maybe you don't have much to say. Maybe you just want to ask a
  ques­tion\, or in­vite peo­ple to help you with your pro­ject\, or boast 
 about some­th­ing you did\, or tell a short cautiona­ry story. These th­in
 gs are all in­terest­ing and worth talk­ing about\, but there might not be
  en­ough to say about them to fill up thir­ty minutes. Maybe you have a lo
 t of th­ings to say\, and you're al­ready going to give a long talk on one
  of them\, and you don't want to hog the spot­light. There's noth­ing wron
 g with giv­ing sever­al Lig­htn­ing Talks. Hey\, they're only five minutes
 . On the other side\, peo­ple might want to come to a lig­htn­ing talk whe
 n they would­n't come to a long talk on the same sub­ject. The risk for th
 e at­tendees is small­er: If the talk turns out to be dull\, or if the per
 ­son giv­ing the talk turns out to be a rea­l­ly bad speak­er\, well\, at 
 least it's over in five minutes. With lig­htn­ing talks\, you're never stu
 ck in some bor­ing lec­ture for forty-five minutes.\n\nStill hav­ing troub
 ­le pick­ing a topic\, here are some sug­ges­tions:\n\n1. Why my favorite 
 module is X.\n2. I want to do cool pro­ject X. Does an­yone want to help?\
 n3. Suc­cess­ful Pro­ject: I did pro­ject X. It was a suc­cess. Here's how
  you could be­nefit.\n4. Failed Pro­ject: I did pro­ject X. It was a failu
 re\, and here's why.\n5. Heresy: Peo­ple al­ways say X\, but they're wrong
 . Here's why.\n6. You All Suck: Here's what is wrong with the our com­mun­
 ity. 7. Call to Ac­tion: Let's all do more of X / less of X.\n8. Would­n't
  it be cool if X?\n9. Some­one needs to do X.\n10. Wish List\n11. Why X wa
 s a mis­take.\n12. Why X looks like a mis­take\, but isn't.\n13. What it's
  like to do X.\n14. Here's a use­ful tech­nique that wor­ked.\n15. Here's 
 a tech­nique I thought would be use­ful but didn't work.\n16. Why al­gorit
 hm X sucks.\n17. Com­parison of al­gorithms X and Y.\n\nOf co­ur­se\, you 
 could give the talk on an­yth­ing you wan­ted\, wheth­er or not it is on t
 his list. If we get a full schedule of noth­ing but five minutes of rant­i
 ng and rav­ing on each topic\, a good time will still be had by most.

DESCRIPTION:PostgreSQL has been growing as the must-have database for the p
 ast few years\, and one of its killer features is its procedural language 
 system\, which gives you (yes you) the ability to write stored database pr
 ocedures in Perl.\n\nIn this talk I'll give a brief taste of the power you
  can wield once you stop just writing Perl to access your database\, and s
 tart putting Perl inside of it. From general installation instructions to 
 basic procedures to fully customized PostgreSQL datatypes\, this is an int
 roduction to a deeper magic of information processing.\n\nA general famili
 arity with relational databases and SQL is recommended.

DESCRIPTION:This is a pared down version of a similar talk I gave at YAPC:N
 A 2012.\n\nThe goal of this presentation is to arm people with some basic 
 approaches to teaching Perl to people outside our community and who may ha
 ve some unfortunately biases.  How can you show that Perl is Modern and mo
 st importantly FUN FUN FUN?\n\nUnlike traditional approaches to teaching P
 erl\, we don't take a 'start from bottom' attitude\, but instead focus on 
 showing beautiful Perl that does a lot with a little\, and provokes a sens
 e of excitement and the desire to learn more.\n\nLessons are drawn from th
 e successes and troubles I encountered teaching Perl at a popular startup 
 incubator site in NYC.

DESCRIPTION:Perl’s regular expression engine provides rich features for mat
 ching and parsing Unicode strings.  Recent releases of Perl have added pow
 erful new modifiers\, character classes\, and other special escape sequenc
 es that can be added to your toolkit.  The functionality of regex metachar
 acters has also been evolving to conform with Unicode standards and it’s i
 mportant to understand the differences.\n\nThis talk will be useful to pro
 grammers of all levels who want to learn about Unicode character propertie
 s and new regex features.  A basic knowledge of regular expressions is req
 uired.

DESCRIPTION:Coverage analysis is enables you to measure the thoroughness of
  the testing of your source code.  Did you test suite exercise all stateme
 nts in your source code?  All subroutines?  By increasing your testing cov
 erage\, you eliminate unreachable code\, tease out ambiguities and reduce 
 the possibility of bugs.\n\nIn Perl the principal tool for coverage analys
 is is Paul Johnson's CPAN distribution Devel-Cover.  In this talk we'll pr
 ovide a brief introduction to that library and show how we used it to impr
 ove the Data-Dumper library distributed with the Perl 5 source code.

DESCRIPTION:Learn about Moose\, the postmodern approach to Object Oriented 
 Programming in Perl\, from Stevan Little (project founder)\, Jesse Luehrs 
 (current lead maintainer of Moose)\, and Shawn Moore (prolific contributor
  to Moose).\n\nMoose extends Perl’s “There’s more than one way to do it” p
 hilosophy with an important addition: “But sometimes consistency is not a 
 bad thing either.” By establishing a common system for building and extend
 ing classes and other components\, Moose empowers developers to reuse code
  like never before. Moose’s built-in features in combination with the exte
 nsive ecosystem of plugins and accessory libraries available on the CPAN a
 llow you to improve your code with features that would otherwise be too co
 mplex or expensive to implement and maintain on your own.\n\nAlthough its 
 compact\, declarative look can seem perplexing at first glance\, Moose is 
 just Perl\, and can be easily explained\, learned\, understood\, and put t
 o use. This tutorial will cover all of Moose’s basic features\, including 
 attributes\, delegation\, method modifiers\, roles\, and types\, as well a
 s best practices for writing Moose code that plays well with others.
