<p>This will be held at the same location on the day after the main conference, on Sunday, April 21, 2013. It is $25 for each half-day -- so you can do both training sessions for $50. Once you've signed up for the conference, you can <a href="http://dcbpw.org/dcbpw2013/purchase">purchase your ticket</a> and select the training sessions (also follow this link if you've already purchased your conference ticket). You do not have to come to the main conference to attend the training sessions! But we'd miss you :)</p>
<p>We'll have on-site payment options if you don't want to decide until the last minute.</p>
<p><h2>Morning - Introduction to Moose</h2></p>
<p>Learn about Moose, the postmodern approach to Object Oriented Programming in Perl, from Stevan Little (project founder), Jesse Luehrs (current lead maintainer of Moose), and Shawn Moore (prolific contributor to Moose).</p>
<p>Moose extends Perl’s “There’s more than one way to do it” philosophy with an important addition: “But sometimes consistency is not a bad thing either.” By establishing a common system for building and extending classes and other components, Moose empowers developers to reuse code like never before. Moose’s built-in features in combination with the extensive ecosystem of plugins and accessory libraries available on the CPAN allow you to improve your code with features that would otherwise be too complex or expensive to implement and maintain on your own.</p>
<p>Although its compact, declarative look can seem perplexing at first glance, Moose is just Perl, and can be easily explained, learned, understood, and put to use. This tutorial will cover all of Moose’s basic features, including attributes, delegation, method modifiers, roles, and types, as well as best practices for writing Moose code that plays well with others.</p>
<p><h2>Afternoon - Web Development 101</h2></p>
<p>Enjoy a comprehensive survey of current web development technologies and techniques, from the basics of HTTP (the protocol that runs the World Wide Web), through browser-based tools that make web development easier than ever, to a review of server-side development and deployment techniques and best practices. This dynamic course is led by Stevan Little, Jesse Luehrs, and Shawn Moore, a group of veteran developers with decades of experience building software on and off the web.</p>
<p>Stevan, Jesse, and Shawn will share their opinionated views of past mistakes, current best practices, and future possibilities in the realm of web development. Expect an exciting and informative afternoon of technology instruction that will give experienced web developers a fresh, vibrant perspective and programmers new to the web a practical introduction to modern tools and techniques.</p> </p>  <h3><a href="news/990">Early Registration Extension</a></h3>
 <p>
    <em>03/01/13 09:00 AM by <a href="http://dcbpw.org/dcbpw2013/user/1650">Brock Wilcox (&lrm;awwaiid&lrm;)</a></em>
    <br /> <p>We hear that some budgets may have just been tightened today... so we are extending the early registration price of $25 for one more week (plus a day for luck)! The extension is through March 8, 2013.</p>
<p>We still have room to squeeze in a few more talks, and we have several tutorial track slots open for teachers. As we've mentioned elsewhere, contact us if you are interested in doing a tutorial and we can help you with material.</p>
<p>Be sure to check out the talks we already have lined up on the <a href="schedule">schedule</a>.</p>
<p>Get it while the gettin's good!</p> </p>  <h3><a href="news/988">Call for Speakers</a></h3>
 <p>
    <em>02/20/13 08:51 PM by <a href="http://dcbpw.org/dcbpw2013/user/1650">Brock Wilcox (&lrm;awwaiid&lrm;)</a></em>
    <br /> <p>Attention Speakers! We still have several slots to fill for the 2013 DC-Baltimore Perl Workshop, which will be held on Saturday April 20 in Baltimore.</p>
<p>We're running two tracks. The first is a general anything-goes-awesomeness track. This track is set to be 20 minute blocks, so that we can get some good variety. Enough to get people a dose of newness, not overwhelm them, and plenty of variety.</p>
<p>The second track is a tutorial track. While we love people who want to give a tutorial they composed themselves, we actually have an archive of very good tutorials that you could use as a foundation. If you want to get some experience doing teaching this is a great way to start. These talks can be a bit longer do to their nature, especially if they are hands-on.</p>
<p>This is also a great regional meetup if you want to polish a talk that you'll be presenting at a larger conference, such as YAPC::NA 2013 in Austin!</p>
<p>If you have any questions, email us!</p> </p>  <h3><a href="news/976">Announcement!</a></h3>

<p>Talk submissions are open, sign up and submit your talk today! We're going to stick with the 20-minute blocks like we had last year, which worked out really well. Tutorials can be longer, especially if they are hands on. More news on that to follow.</p>
<p>This year we have a wonderful venue in the heart of Baltimore, a stones throw from Penn Station - we'll get the location detail page up, but in the meantime:</p>
